Module      : Control.Monad.Watson
Description : A much purer soul than Holmes.
Copyright   : (c) Tom Harding, 2020
License     : MIT

Watson works in a near-identical way to Holmes, but with one distinction: its
base type is 'ST' rather than 'IO', so the API calculates the results with
"observably pure" functions. There are downsides: for example, 'Watson' can't
perform random restart with operations like 'Control.Monad.Holmes.shuffle'.
However, this is often an acceptable compromise to avoid 'IO' entirely!
