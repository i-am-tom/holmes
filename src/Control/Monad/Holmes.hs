Module      : Control.Monad.Holmes
Description : A monad for constructing constraint-solving computations, and executing them inside 'IO'.
Copyright   : (c) Tom Harding, 2020
License     : MIT

'Holmes' is a type for solving constraint problems. These computations are
executed with 'IO', which allows for extra features such as the ability to
'shuffle' the input configuration.

If this isn't a feature you require, you may prefer to use the
"Control.Monad.Watson" interface, which offers a pure version of the API thanks
to its use of 'Control.Monad.ST'. The internal code is shared between the two,
so results between the two are consistent.

-- randomising the order in which refinements are given. This is similar to the
-- "random restart" strategy in hill-climbing problems.

-- Another nice use for this function is procedural generation: often, your
