Module      : Data.Propagator
Description : The high-level propagator abstraction.
Copyright   : (c) Tom Harding, 2020
License     : MIT

The real heart of a propagator network is the cell-level interaction, but it
doesn't come with a particularly pleasant API. The solution is the 'Prop'
abstraction, which hides away some of the more gruesome internals.

This module exposes a set of functions to construct propagator networks with a
"focal point", which we can intuit as being the "output" of the functions we're
used to writing.

The important thing to note is that most of these functions allow for
__multi-directional__ information flow. While '(.&&)' might /look/ like '(&&)',
it allows the inputs to be computed from the outputs, so it's a lot more
capable. Think of these functions as a way to build equations that we can
re-arrange as need be.
